            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The premise of this game is to correctly identify pairs of numbers within a set of cards.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ul class="text"> 
                <li>Upon starting a game, you will be shown all cards face-up for 5 seconds to give you a chance to memorize them.</li>
                <li>The cards will then be turned face down and you must find the pairs again.</li>
                <li>Correct matches will leave the cards face-up, while incorrect pairs will be turned back face-down.</li>
                <li>You win by matching every card on the board, and you lose by either running out of time or exceeding the maximum number of fails.</li>
            </ul>  
        </section>

        <section class="settings">
            <h2>Settings</h2>
            <ul class="text">
                <li>The Theme option allows you to change the theme of the website between a peaceful, flower-like theme and a deadly, nightmarish theme</li>
                <li>The difficulty option allows you to pick the difficulty of the game. Easy is a 4x4 grid of cards, medium is a 6x4 grid, hard is an 8x4 grid, and expert is an 8x6 grid.<br>
				Higher difficutly = greater multiplier. This affects both your base score and the amount lost per fail. Higher risk, but higher potential reward!</li>
                <li>The Max Fails option allows you to set the maximum allotted fails for the game. A fail occurs when you click the second card in a pair and it does not match the first.</li>
                <li>The Max Time option allows you to set the maximum allowed time to complete the game. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="modifiers">
            <h2>Party Modifiers</h2>
            <p>Party modifiers are bonus settings for the game that either change the visuals or gameplay in a unique way. If any party modifiers are active, a win in the game will not be added to the leaderboard.</p>
            <ul class="text">
                <li>The Bombs mode adds a pair of bombs to the grid of cards. If the user matches the pair of bombs, they automatically lose the game.</li>
                <li>The Disco mode makes the colors of all cards random. There is no correlation between colors and pairs, it is completely random.</li>
                <li>The Hardcore mode makes it so that anytime the user fails, all cards are shuffled to random positions.</li>
